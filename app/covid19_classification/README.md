# ðŸ§¬ COVID-19 Chest X-ray Classification

This project demonstrates how to train a CNN model to classify chest X-ray images into **NORMAL** or **PNEUMONIA** (COVID-19-related) cases. The model is built and trained using a simple Keras/TensorFlow pipeline in a Jupyter Notebook.

## ðŸ§  Features

- Simple CNN built using Keras Sequential API
- Binary classification: NORMAL vs. PNEUMONIA
- Real-world medical image preprocessing (resizing, normalization)
- Plots of training vs. validation accuracy/loss
- For dataset used refer: [Chest Xray Covid Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prashant268/chest-xray-covid19-pneumonia)
